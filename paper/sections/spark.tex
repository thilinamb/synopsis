\subsection{Use with Analytic Engines}
\textsc{Synopsis} can be used to generate synthetic data that requires less space while providing an effective representation of the actual data.
Such synthetic datasets can be used efficiently with analytic engines such as Spark and Tensorflow.

We used Apache Spark to train a regression model based on Random Forests ensemble method to predict temperature using surface visibility, humidity and precipitation.
Different models were generated using the actual data and synthetic data sets representing 10\% and 20\% of the actual data.
The accuracy of these models were measured using the a test dataset extracted from actual observations.
The data was staged on HDFS and loaded into Spark to train the ensemble models.

We evaluated the efficacy of our approach based on the on-disk and in-memory storage requirements, data loading time, training time and the accuracy of the model.

Our observations are summarized in table~\ref{tab:spark-rf}.
The accuracy of the models generated based on synthetic data is comparable to the accuracy of the models generated using actual data.
But they require less space and reduces the training time significantly.
For instance, 10\% synthetic dataset produces a model with similar accuracy incurring 53\% less training time while reducing the space requirement by 90\%.
