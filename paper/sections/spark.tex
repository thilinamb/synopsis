\subsection{Use with Analytic Engines}
Synthetic data queries in \textsc{Synopsis} can be used to generate representative datasets that require less space while still providing high accuracy.  
Such synthetic datasets can be used efficiently with analytic engines such as Apache Spark \cite{zaharia2010spark} and TensorFlow \cite{tensorflow}.  
We used Spark to train regression models based on the Random Forest ensemble method to predict temperatures using surface visibility, humidity and precipitation.
These models were generated using the original full-resolution data as well as synthetic data sets that were sized at 10\% and 20\% of the original data.
The accuracy of these models were measured using the a test dataset extracted from actual observations.
All three datasets were staged on HDFS and loaded into Spark to train the ensemble models.

We evaluated the efficacy of our approach based on the on-disk and in-memory storage requirements, data loading time, training time and the accuracy of the model.

Our observations are summarized in table~\ref{tab:spark-rf}.
The accuracy of the models generated based on synthetic data is comparable to the accuracy of the models generated using actual data.
But they require less space and reduces the training time significantly.
For instance, 10\% synthetic dataset produces a model with similar accuracy incurring 53\% less training time while reducing the space requirement by 90\%.
