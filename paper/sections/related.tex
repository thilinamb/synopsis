Galileo \cite{} is a distributed hash table that supports the storage and retrieval of multidimensional data. Given the overlap in problem domain, Galileo is faced with several of the same challenges as Synopsis. However, the avenues for overcoming these issues diverge significantly due to differences in storage philosophy: Synopsis maintains its dataset completely in main memory, avoiding the orders-of-magnitude disparity in I/O throughput associated with secondary storage systems. This makes Synopsis highly agile, allowing on-demand scaling to rapidly respond to changes in incoming load. Additionally, this constraint influenced the trade-off space involved when designing our algorithms, making careful and efficient memory management a priority while striving for high accuracy.
