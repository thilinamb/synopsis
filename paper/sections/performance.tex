\section{Performance Evaluation}
\label{sec:performance}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
Our subject dataset was sourced from the NOAA North American Mesoscale (NAM) Forecast System \cite{noaa_nam}.  The NAM collects atmospheric data several times per day and includes features of interest such as surface temperature, visibility, relative humidity, snow, and precipitation. Each observation in the dataset also incorporates a relevant geographical location and time of creation. This information is used during the data ingest process to partition streams across available computing resources and preserve temporal ordering of events.

Our performance evaluation was carried out on a 75-node heterogeneous cluster consisting of 45 HP DL160 servers (Xeon E5620, 12 GB RAM) and 30 HP DL320e servers (Xeon E3-1220 V2, 8 GB RAM) running Fedora 23. Rivulet was executed under the OpenJDK Java runtime, version 1.8.0\_72.
