\subsection{Dataset and Experimental Setup}
Our subject dataset was sourced from the NOAA North American Mesoscale (NAM) Forecast System \cite{noaa_nam}.  The NAM collects atmospheric data several times per day and includes features of interest such as surface temperature, visibility, relative humidity, snow, and precipitation. Each observation in the dataset also incorporates a relevant geographical location and time of creation. This information is used during the data ingest process to partition streams across available computing resources and preserve temporal ordering of events. The size of the entire source dataset was 25 TB.

Performance evaluations throughout the paper were carried out on a cluster of 40 HP DL160 servers (Xeon E5620, 12 GB RAM). For our application benchmarks on Apache Spark (version 2.0.1 with HDFS 2.6.0), we used our baseline cluster of 40 machines as well as 30 HP DL320e servers (Xeon E3-1220 V2, 8 GB RAM) and 30 HP DL60 servers (Xeon E5-2620, 16 GB RAM). The test cluster was configured to run Fedora 24, and \textsc{Synopsis} was executed under the OpenJDK Java runtime 1.8.0\_72.
